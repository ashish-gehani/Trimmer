  * Non-maintainer upload.
  * Refresh patches, keep all changed hunks except some changes in

    allows the init script correct operations. This also fixes "status
    operation on init.d not working correctly (needs to pass $PIDFILE to
    status_of_proc)", however add the $PIDFILE argument additionally none-

memcached (1.4.2-1) unstable; urgency=medium

  * New upstream release, primarily bugfixes, some of them critical, hence

      possible.
    - Code cleanup, lots of bugs fixed, added tests, enhanced documentation.

memcached (1.2.8-1) unstable; urgency=high

  * New upstream release, urgency=high because of two critical bugs prior
    to this release:
    - In 1.2.7 under multithreaded mode, memcached would never restart
      accepting connections after hitting the maximum connection limit.

      usable if versions prior to 1.2.8 ever have buffer overflows discovered
      (CVE-2009-1494).  Closes: #526554.
    - Make -b command (setting the TCP listen backlog) actually work.
