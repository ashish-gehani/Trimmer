.Sh DESCRIPTION
.Nm
is a userspace bandwidth manager.  Currently, 
.Nm
supports the shaping of any SOCK_STREAM (see
.Xr socket 2 )
connection established via the 
.Xr socket 2
interface.  Furthermore, 
.Nm
will not work with statically linked executables, nor with 
.Xr setuid 2
executables.
.Nm
is highly configurable; download and upload rates can be set
separately, or in an aggregate fashion.
.Pp
The options are as follows:
.Bl -tag -width Ds_imagedir 
.It Fl h
Displays help.
.It Fl v
Increases the verbosity level (can be specified multiple times).
.It Fl V
Prints version.
.It Fl s
Runs trickle in standalone mode, independent of 
.Xr trickled 8 .
.It Fl d Ar rate
Limit the download bandwidth consumption to 
.Ar rate
KB/s.
.It Fl u Ar rate
Limit the upload bandwidth consumption to 
.Ar rate
KB/s.
.It Fl w Ar length
Set peak detection window size to 
.Ar length
KB.  This determines how aggressive 
.Nm
is at eliminating bandwidth consumption peaks.  Lower values will be
more aggressive, but may also result in over shaping.  The default
value (512 KB) is usually sufficient.
.It Fl t Ar seconds
Set smoothing time to
.Ar seconds 
s.  The smoothing time determines with what intervals 
.Nm
will try to let the application transceive data.  Smaller values will
result in a more continuous (smooth) session, while larger values may
produce bursts in the sending and receiving data.  Smaller values (0.1
- 1 s) are ideal for interactive applications while slightly larger
values (1 - 10 s) are better for applications that need bulk transfer.
.It Fl l Ar length
Set smoothing length to
.Ar length 
KB.  The smoothing length is a fallback of the smoothing time.  If 
.Nm
cannot meet the requested smoothing time, it will instead fall back on
sending 
.Ar length
KB of data.  The default value is 10 KB.
.It Fl n Ar path
Use 
.Xr trickled 8
socket 
.Ar path 
to communicate with 
.Xr trickled 8 .
By default, 
.Ar /tmp/.trickled.sock
is used.
.It Fl P Ar path
Use the specified .so instead of the standard one, this is useful if you don't
run trickle from a standard installation.

.Sh EXAMPLES
.Cm trickle -u 10 -d 20 ncftp
.Pp
Launch
.Xr ncftp 1
limiting its upload capacity to 10 KB/s, and download capacity at 20
KB/s.
