.Sh DESCRIPTION
.Nm
is a userspace bandwidth manager daemon.
.Nm
manages several
.Xr trickle 1
sessions at a time, shaping across multiple sessions.
.Pp
The options are as follows:
.Bl -tag -width Ds_imagedir
.It Fl v
Increases the verbosity level (can be specified multiple times).
.It Fl V
Prints version.
.It Fl f
Runs
.Nm
in the foreground.
.It Fl s
Uses syslog for all output (instead of stderr).
.It Fl d Ar rate
Limit the download bandwidth consumption to 
.Ar rate
KB/s.
.It Fl u Ar rate
Limit the upload bandwidth consumption to 
.Ar rate
KB/s.
.It Fl t Ar seconds
Set smoothing time to
.Ar seconds 
s.  The smoothing time determines with what intervals 
.Nm
will try to let the application transceive data.  Smaller values will
result in a more continuous (smooth) session, while larger values may
produce bursts in the sending and receiving data.  Smaller values (0.1
- 1 s) are ideal for interactive applications while slightly larger
values (1 - 10 s) are better for applications that need bulk transfer.
This parameter is customizable on a per-application basis via
.Xr trickled.conf 5 .
The default value is 5 s.
.It Fl l Ar length
Set smoothing length to
.Ar length 
KB.  The smoothing length is a fallback of the smoothing time.  If 
.Nm
cannot meet the requested smoothing time, it will instead fall back on
sending 
.Ar length
KB of data.  The default value is 10 KB.
.It Fl p Ar priority
Set default priority to 
.Ar priority .
.It Fl c Ar file
Use the configuration file
.Ar file .
This file must be of the format documented in 
.Xr trickled.conf 5 .
.It Fl n Ar path
Set socket name to 
.Ar path .
By default, 
.Nm
uses
.Ar /tmp/.trickled.sock .
.It Fl N Ar seconds
Notifies user of total bandwidth consumption every
.Ar seconds
s.
.It Fl w Ar size
Set peak detection window size to 
.Ar size
KB.  This determines how aggressive 
.Nm
is at eliminating bandwidth consumption peaks.  Lower values will be
more aggressive, but may also result in over shaping.  The default
value (512 KB) is usually sufficient.
.El
.Sh EXAMPLES
.Cm trickled -u 10 -d 20
.Pp
Limit aggregate 
.Xr trickle 1
upload bandwidth consumption to 10 KB/s and download consumption to 20 KB/s.
