Noteworthy changes in release 4.11 (2015-12-21)
===============================================

* Changes in behavior
  * Some syscalls have different names depending on architecture and
    personality.  In these cases, syscall filtering and printing now
    consistently uses the names that match corresponding __NR_* kernel
    macros of the tracee's architecture and personality.
  * Added strace prefix to all diagnostic messages.

  * Enhanced and extended test suite.
  * Implemented reliable tracing of processes whose personality differs
    from the personality of strace, fixed decoding of 32-bit personality
    syscalls on 64-bit architectures.
  * When some data referenced by syscall arguments is irrelevant or cannot
    be read from tracee's memory, strace now prints its address consistently.
  * When a syscall is restarted using restart_syscall mechanism, strace now
    shows the syscall name on architectures that expose this information.

* Handle new mq_* system calls in Linux 2.6.6 and later.

Changes in 4.5.2
==============
* Bug fixes.
* Report some new VM_* bit values on Linux.

Changes in 4.5.1
==============
* Bug fixes.
* Display multiple ioctl name matches on Linux.

Changes in 4.5
==============
* New port to AMD's x86-64 architecture. One strace binary can
  handle both new x86-64 and old i386 processes.
* Fixed support for LFS64 calls.
* New switch -E to add/remove environment variables for the command.
* Merged s390/s390x port.
* Trace an unbounded number of processes.
* Handle numerous new system calls in Linux 2.5, and new threads semantics.
* Fixed bugs with attach/detach leaving things stopped.
* Fixed traced process seeing ECHILD despite live, traced children
  in waitpid calls with WNOHANG.
* Stuart Menefy contributed a port to Linux/SH.
* Stephen Thomas contributed a port to Linux/SH64.
* Many other bug fixes.

Changes in 4.4
==============
* Fix Linux/ia64 support, looks like someone renamed a few things on us
* Fix the ioctl setup for Linux, turned out it did not really work.
  Improve the ioctl extracter as well so we decode some more ones.

Changes in 4.3.1
================
* compile fixes for Linux/mips

Changes in 4.3
==============
* Linux ia64 and hppa ports added
* The usual Linux syscall updates (includes 32bit uid/gid support),
* Linux ioctl list updated
* Support IPv6 scope ids
* FreeBSD/i386 port added
* UnixWare and Solaris updates
* Better support for tracing multithreaded processes in Linux

Changes in 4.2
==============
* Compiles on glibc2.0 systems again
* Linux/S390 port added
* The usual Linux syscall updates
* we can follow fork on arm now

Changes in 4.1
================
* Linux/MIPS port added
* Lots of Linux updates again
* Improved IPv6 support
* Add strace-graph

Changes in 4.0.1
================
* Minor bugfixes
* Compiles on glibc2.0 systems again

Changes in 4.0
==============
* Get stat structure properly on Linux 64bit archs
* Personalities work again
* Compile correctly on SunOS again
* IRIX64 updates
* Solaris updates

Changes in 3.99.1
=================
* Linux (ultra)sparc fixes
* Linux alpha fixes
* Minor cleanups

Changes in 3.99
===============
* New maintainer
* add support for more Linux architectures (powerpc, sparc, arm)
* support lots more Linux syscalls
* fix signal handling
* add IPX and IPIP support
* check stray syscall after execv
* fix hanging children

Changes in version 3.1
======================

* Irix5 is supported
* Linux 68k is supported
* Linux alpha is supported
* configure is upgraded to autoconf 2.x
* using -f in combination with -e now works correctly
* output can be piped to a program
* tracing setuid programs works better
* it is now reasonable to install strace setuid to root in some circumstances
* new useful tracing names like file and process to trace whole
  classes of system calls, e.g. -efile traces all system calls that
  take a file name as an argument
* IPC calls on SunOS 4.1.x are decoded
* Linux program memory is reliably dereferenced
* Linux decodes at least the name of all syscalls as of pre2.0.4
* various cosmetic changes and bug fixes

Changes from versions 2.x to version 3.0
========================================

* filename arguments are neither abbreviated nor stringified
* string arguments are now true C strings using octal instead of hex by default
* preprocessor constants are never shortened (e.g. was RDONLY => now O_RDONLY)
* by default the output for multiple processes now goes into one file
* all structures, vectors, bitsets, etc. use consistent output formats
* the -c option now means count calls, -i does what the old -c used to do

New Features in version 3.0
===========================

* non-ascii strings can be optionally printed entirely in hex
* the output format is readable when mutiple processes are generating output
* exit values are printed in an alignment column
* is is possible to suppress messages about attaching and detaching
* various tracing features can be enabled on a per syscall/signal/desc basis
* selective tracing of syscalls
* selective printing of syscall structures
* selective abbreviation of long structures on a per syscall basis
* selective printing of raw syscall arguments and results
* selective tracing of signals
* selective dumping of all I/O read from file descriptors
* selective dumping of all I/O written to file descriptors
* optional counting of time, calls, and errors for each syscall
