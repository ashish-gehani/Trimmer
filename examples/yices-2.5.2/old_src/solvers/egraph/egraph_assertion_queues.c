 * Queue for storing assertions sent by egraph to theory solvers.
 *
 * The assertions are of the following forms:
 *   v1 == v2
 *   v1 != v2 with a hint
 *   distinct v[0] ... v[n-1] with a hint
 * where v1, v2, etc. are theory variable. The hint is a composite_t
 * object that the egraph requires to generate explanations.
 *
 * Each assertion is stored as the following data
 * - tag: encode the assertion type (eq, diseq, distinct)
 *        and number of variables (2 or n)
 * - hint: is stored as is for explanation
 * - v[0 ... n-1]: the variables involved
