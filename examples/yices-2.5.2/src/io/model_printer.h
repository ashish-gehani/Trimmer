 * DISPLAY A MODEL
 */

/*
 * The code for displaying a model used to be in model.c
 * but it couldn't print the value of "x" if "x" is in the model's
 * alias table.
 *
 * This is a more general version: it can print the value assigned
 * to x if x is in the alias or map table. This requires the evaluator.
