As of release 1.5beta1, tcptraceroute now uses GNU autoconf to ease the
task of installation and to provide better portability.  As with all
programs utilizing autoconf, the simplest way to compile the package is
(quoting from the default INSTALL documentation that ships with
autoconf):

  1. `cd' to the directory containing the package's source code and type
     `./configure' to configure the package for your system.  If you're
     using `csh' on an old version of System V, you might need to type
     `sh ./configure' instead to prevent `csh' from trying to execute
     `configure' itself.

     Running `configure' takes awhile.  While running, it prints some
     messages telling which features it is checking for.

  2. Type `make' to compile the package.

  3. Type `make install' to install the programs and any data files and
     documentation.

  4. You can remove the program binaries and object files from the
     source code directory by typing `make clean'.  To also remove the
     files that `configure' created (so you can compile the package for
     a different kind of computer), type `make distclean'.

The configure scripts supports a number of command line options.  The
ones you're most likely to use are:

	  --prefix=PREFIX         install architecture-independent files in
                                  PREFIX [/usr/local]
	  --with-libpcap=DIR      use libpcap in DIR
	  --with-libnet=DIR       use libnet in DIR
	  --enable-noselect-default
				  default to not using select(2)
	  --enable-track-default=PORT|ID
				  default to tracking probes by PORT or ID
	  --enable-default-port=N default destination port
	  --enable-static         compile staticly, if using gcc
