    Closes: #269143: FTBFS: unsatisfiable build-dependency
  * debian/control, debian/rules: debhelper compatability 4
  * debian/control: standards version 3.5.10 -> 3.6.1; no changes required.

tcptraceroute (1.4-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * new upstream version:
    -  Added linklayer support for Linux ISDN Sync-PPP interfaces.
    -  Adds support back for DLT_RAW interfaces, which was inadvertently
       removed sometime between 1.2 and 1.3beta1, and as a result caused

 -- David Coe <davidc@debian.org>  Wed, 31 Jul 2002 12:34:09 -0400

tcptraceroute (1.3-1) unstable; urgency=low
  * new upstream release.  Quoth the author:
     - greatly improved command line handling,
     - properly aligning packet data for architectures which don't allow non-aligned memory access,
     - the ability to traceroute to a local IP address,
     - the ability to probe with TCP ACK packets, making it possible to traceroute through stateless
       firewalls that permit hosts sitting behind the firewall to establish outbound connections,
     - the ability to track probes by source port numbers instead of IP ID's, making it possible for
       tcptraceroute to function properly on Solaris.
    Closes: #147463: Show if remote host supports ECN if -E is used
    Closes: #136999: tcptraceroute: relies on bpf to filter tcp correctly
  * install tcptraceroute to usr/bin instead of usr/sbin.
