curl (7.32.0-1) unstable; urgency=low

  From this version the threaded DNS resolver will be used. This allows for
  asynchronous DNS queries and also fixes possible issues related to handling
  time outs of DNS lookups.

  The threaded resolver was chosen instead of the event-based one (which uses
  the c-ares library) because c-ares currently lacks somewhat important
  features, such as support for the Name Service Switch system.

curl (7.28.1-1) experimental; urgency=low

  From this version the CURLOPT_SSL_VERIFYHOST option will stop accepting "1"
  as a valid value. From the documentation:

  > When the value is 1, libcurl will return a failure. It was previously (in
  > 7.28.0 and earlier) a debug option of some sorts, but it is no longer
  > supported due to frequently leading to programmer mistakes.
