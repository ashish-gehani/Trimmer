Adding New Patches
==================

Note that when adding new patches they must be applied *before* 90_gnutls.patch
and 99_nss.patch. This is needed by curl's package byzantine build process,
which builds the source multiple times with different TLS libraries.

This basically means that when adding new patches to the debian/patches/series
file, they must be listed before the aformentioned patches.
