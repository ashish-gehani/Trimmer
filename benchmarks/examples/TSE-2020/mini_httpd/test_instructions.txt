The test for mini_httpd can be run by: make test_mini

Error fixes:
-> "bind: Address already in use": You probably need to kill a process using the port in your config or change the port in config and rerun trimmer
-> "mkdir: cannot create directory â€˜workdirâ€™: File exists": Delete the workdir directory before running test
-> Permission error: run the test as a superuser: sudo make test_mini
