Running Trimmer on all applications with runbench script
=======

1) Build Trimmer on your machine

2) Run `./runbench.py --sets="trimmer.set" --trimmer-opts=""`

3) Finally, run `bash reset.sh` before running the rubench script again. reset.sh deletes old executables and bitcode of applications to allow runbench script to be used again


The runbench.py script will run Trimmer on all applications and print the statistics in a table. Trimmer can be run with different options such as loop-unroll, string-specialize and file-specialize. user can provide these options through --trimmer-opts. e.g if anyone is only interested in running Trimmer with loop-unroll pass, run this command **./runbench.py --sets="trimmer.set" --trimmer-opts="loop-unroll"**. Options available with trimmer can be found [here](https://github.com/ashish-gehani/Trimmer/blob/master/docs/options.md).

### Logging:
Logs generated by the runbench script are saved in the "Logs" folder in the running directory. To change the default directory for the log files, use the **--temp-dirs=\<dir\>** flag. To disable logging, use the **--delete-temps** flag.
